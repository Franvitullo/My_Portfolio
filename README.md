## Project_1: Bacteria from the rhizosphere of fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) as plant growth enhancers.



As part of my biotech engineering degree I did my thesis on crop improvement through biofertilizers.<br />

Abstract

In this thesis, the productivity of fescue (*Lolium arundinaceum*) was improved by inoculation with
bacteria from soils of the Pampa region.
From a set of 56 strains, those that presented good production of indole-3-acetic acid (a plant hormone) 
and empirical improvements in germination and plant growth were selected. Tests were performed on the
strains of greatest interest to identify them taxonomicallyand characterize their PGPR capacity.

Conclusions
The results show that the rhizosphere accumulates a potential number of bacteria capable of promoting 
plant growth, which are sustainable and agroecological alternatives to traditional fertilizers.

Inoculation with strain F31AD (Rahnella aquatilis) to fescue seeds (Lolium arundinaceum) significantly
improves germination and, consequently, production.Inoculation with the 4G1C strain
(belonging to the Pseudomonas genus) improves root architecture and the number of leaves in L. arundinaceum.

By co-inoculating with both bacterial strains an additive effect is achieved. 
Improving germination, root architecture and number of leaves.

### Project_2: Use of screens in people with children and its impact with the pandemic

Those who are mothers or fathers, how much time do they spend on screen?

The pandemic changed the relationship we all have with technology. Specifically, those people who have children, increased the daily exposure time to screens in the best case, 1 hour and in the worst, more than 8 hours.

The results pre covid and during the covid-19 pandemic are as follows:

Average screen time:
-0 to 1 hour: went from 17.4% to 7.3% ðŸ ‹
-2 to 3 hours: it went from 44.7% to 19.0% ðŸ ‹ ðŸ ‹
-4 to 5 hours: it went from 22.8% to 29.4% ðŸ ‰
-6 to 7 hours: it went from 7.7% to 21.3% ðŸ ‰ðŸ ‰
-8 to 9 hours: it went from 2.9% to 11.8% ðŸ ‰ðŸ ‰ðŸ ‰
-more than 9 hours: it went from 4.5% to 11.2% ðŸ ‰ðŸ ‰

As you might imagine, the exposure time increased considerably. The causes are many and already known.

But knowing this leads us to other questions, Are we aware of this? In this new post-pandemic context, it is important to reassess habits that we have acquired and perhaps did not realize.
