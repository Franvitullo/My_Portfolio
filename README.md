### Project_1: Bacteria from the rhizosphere of fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) as plant growth enhancers.

To finish my engineering degree, I did my thesis on crop improvement through biofertilizers.

```
Abstract

In this thesis, the productivity of fescue (*Lolium arundinaceum*) 
was improved by inoculation with bacteria from soils of the Pampa region.
From a set of 56 strains, those that presented good production of 
indole-3-acetic acid (a plant hormone) and empirical improvements in 
germination and plant growth were selected. Tests were performed on the
strains of greatest interest to identify them taxonomically
and characterize their PGPR capacity.
