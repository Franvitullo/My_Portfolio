## Project_1: Bacteria from the rhizosphere of fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) as plant growth enhancers.



As part of my biotech engineering degree I did my thesis on crop improvement through biofertilizers.<br />

Abstract

In this thesis, the productivity of fescue (*Lolium arundinaceum*) was improved by inoculation with
bacteria from soils of the Pampa region.
From a set of 56 strains, those that presented good production of indole-3-acetic acid (a plant hormone) 
and empirical improvements in germination and plant growth were selected. Tests were performed on the
strains of greatest interest to identify them taxonomicallyand characterize their PGPR capacity.

Conclusions
The results show that the rhizosphere accumulates a potential number of bacteria capable of promoting 
plant growth, which are sustainable and agroecological alternatives to traditional fertilizers.

Inoculation with strain F31AD (Rahnella aquatilis) to fescue seeds (Lolium arundinaceum) significantly
improves germination and, consequently, production.Inoculation with the 4G1C strain
(belonging to the Pseudomonas genus) improves root architecture and the number of leaves in L. arundinaceum.

By co-inoculating with both bacterial strains an additive effect is achieved. 
Improving germination, root architecture and number of leaves.
